# CUDA Lab Hello
In the first part of this lab we ran a dummy kernel an printed hello world on host side.
In the second part of the lab, we printed in the device side of the code. By increasing the number of threads some characters were repeated. By increasing the block number, the same operation was repeated multiple times.
