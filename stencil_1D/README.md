# CUDA Lab Stencil
In the simple version we implemented, each thread read the required information to compute the stencil, which resulted in a multiple memory accesses for the same values.
In the modified version, each thread loaded one element into shared memory (much faster than global memory) thus strongly reducing the access time. This required a `__syncthreads()` call to synchronize threads of the same block.
